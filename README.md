# react-babel-webpack-setup
A reactjs webpack babel setup

I 've been using create-react-app and parcel to learn react but I always wanted to make the configuration 
by myself because I needed to understand what is happenning behind and I needed the flexibility that a custom config 
could provide.
I am using cross-env for the enviromental variables to be able to change from development to production.
So this setup is ready to use as a react template.
Feel free to share :)
